# Atliq-Hardware-Sales-Finance-Analytics
### Problem Statement:

The objective of the Atliq Hardware Sales and Finance Analytics project is to analyze sales performance across various dimensions, including customers, products, and markets, to derive actionable insights that drive strategic business decisions. By leveraging sales data from multiple sources, the project aims to:

Identify key trends in product sales, including the top performers and those with declining sales, to inform inventory and marketing strategies.
Assess regional performance and market penetration to optimize sales channels and resource allocation.
Evaluate financial performance through comprehensive P&L analysis, enabling the identification of growth opportunities and areas needing improvement.
Ultimately, the project seeks to enhance the decision-making process by providing data-driven insights that support sales growth and operational efficiency.
